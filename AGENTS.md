## Conversations (Self-Learning)

Learn the user's habits, preferences, and working style. Extract rules from conversations, save to "## Rules to follow", and generate code according to the user's personal rules.

**Update requirement (core mechanism):**

Before doing ANY task, evaluate the latest user message.
If you detect a new rule, correction, preference, or change -> update `AGENTS.md` first.
Only after updating the file you may produce the task output.
If no new rule is detected -> do not update the file.

**When to extract rules:**

- prohibition words (never, don't, stop, avoid) or similar -> add NEVER rule
- requirement words (always, must, make sure, should) or similar -> add ALWAYS rule
- memory words (remember, keep in mind, note that) or similar -> add rule
- process words (the process is, the workflow is, we do it like) or similar -> add to workflow
- future words (from now on, going forward) or similar -> add permanent rule

**Preferences -> add to Preferences section:**

- positive (I like, I prefer, this is better) or similar -> Likes
- negative (I don't like, I hate, this is bad) or similar -> Dislikes
- comparison (prefer X over Y, use X instead of Y) or similar -> preference rule

**Corrections -> update or add rule:**

- error indication (this is wrong, incorrect, broken) or similar -> fix and add rule
- repetition frustration (don't do this again, you ignored, you missed) or similar -> emphatic rule
- manual fixes by user -> extract what changed and why

**Strong signal (add IMMEDIATELY):**

- swearing, frustration, anger, sarcasm -> critical rule
- ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!, ???) -> high priority
- same mistake twice -> permanent emphatic rule
- user undoes your changes -> understand why, prevent

**Ignore (do NOT add):**

- temporary scope (only for now, just this time, for this task) or similar
- one-off exceptions
- context-specific instructions for current task only

**Rule format:**

- One instruction per bullet
- Tie to category (Testing, Code, Docs, etc.)
- Capture WHY, not just what
- Remove obsolete rules when superseded

### Task Delivery (ALL TASKS)

- Always keep package and project identity as `ManagedCode.MCPGateway`.
- Always use `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` and the official `ModelContextProtocol` .NET SDK as the integration foundation.
- Never introduce Microsoft Agentic Framework into this repository unless the user explicitly re-opens that requirement.
- Start from the root docs and packaging files before making structural changes:
  - `README.md`
  - `Directory.Build.props`
  - `Directory.Packages.props`
  - `global.json`
  - `.github/workflows/*`
- Keep scope explicit before coding:
  - in scope
  - out of scope
- Implement code and tests together for every behavior change.
- Keep the gateway reusable as a NuGet library, not as an app-specific host.
- Preserve one public execution surface for local `AITool` instances and MCP tools.
- Preserve one searchable catalog that supports vector ranking when embeddings are available and lexical fallback when they are not.
- For multilingual or noisy search inputs, prefer a generic English-normalization step before ranking when an AI/query-rewrite component is available, because the user wants the searchable representation to converge to English instead of relying only on language-specific token overlap.
- Keep meta-tools available through `McpGatewayToolSet` and `IMcpGateway.CreateMetaTools(...)`.
- If a user adds or corrects a persistent workflow rule, update `AGENTS.md` first and only then continue with the task.

### Repository Layout

- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/` contains the package source.
- `tests/ManagedCode.MCPGateway.Tests/` contains integration-style package tests.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Abstractions/` contains public interfaces, grouped by concern when needed.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Configuration/` contains public configuration types and service keys.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Models/` contains public contracts grouped by behavior such as search, invocation, catalog, and embeddings.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Embeddings/` contains public embedding-store implementations.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Internal/` contains internal catalog, runtime, and helper implementation details.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Registration/` contains DI registration extensions.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/McpGateway.cs` is the public gateway facade.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/Internal/Runtime/` contains the internal runtime orchestration implementation, grouped by core, catalog, search, invocation, and embeddings responsibilities.
- `src/ManagedCode.MCPGateway/McpGatewayToolSet.cs` exposes the gateway as reusable `AITool` meta-tools.
- `.codex/skills/` contains repo-local MCAF skills for Codex.
- Keep the source tree explicitly modular: separate public API folders from `Internal/` implementation folders, and group runtime classes by responsibility in dedicated folders instead of dumping search, indexing, invocation, registry, and infrastructure files into the package root, because flat structure hides boundaries and invites god-object design.

### Skills (ALL TASKS)

- Keep repo-local MCAF skills under `.codex/skills/`, not in ad-hoc folders.
- Keep one workflow per skill folder with a required `SKILL.md`.
- Keep skill metadata concise and fix the YAML `description` when a skill mis-triggers.
- Keep skill folders lean: only `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, and agent metadata when needed.
- Validate skills after skill changes with `skills-validate`.
- Regenerate the available-skills metadata block with `skills-metadata` when skill inventory or metadata changes.

### Documentation (ALL TASKS)

- Update `README.md` whenever public API shape, setup, or usage changes.
- Keep the README focused on package usage and onboarding, not internal implementation notes.
- Document optional DI dependencies explicitly in README examples so consumers know which services they must register themselves, such as embedding generators.
- Keep README code examples as real example code blocks, not commented-out pseudo-code; if behavior is optional, show it in a separate example instead of commenting lines inside another snippet.
- Never leave empty placeholder setup blocks in README examples such as `// gateway configuration`; show a concrete minimal configuration that actually demonstrates the API.
- Keep repo docs and skills in English to stay aligned with MCAF conventions.
- Keep root packaging metadata centralized in `Directory.Build.props`.
- Keep package versions centralized in `Directory.Packages.props`.
- Keep workflow logic only in `.github/workflows/`.

### Testing (ALL TASKS)

- Test framework in this repository is TUnit. Never add or keep xUnit here.
- This repository uses `TUnit` on `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`; never use VSTest-only flags such as `--filter` or `--logger`, because they are not supported here.
- For TUnit solution runs, always invoke `dotnet test --solution ...`; do not pass the solution path positionally.
- Every behavior change must include or update tests in `tests/ManagedCode.MCPGateway.Tests/`.
- Keep tests focused on real gateway behavior:
  - local tool indexing and invocation
  - MCP tool indexing and invocation
  - vector search behavior
  - lexical fallback behavior
- Keep embedding-based search covered with deterministic local tests by using a fake or test-only embedding generator.
- Keep request context behavior covered when search or invocation consumes contextual inputs.
- Do not remove tests to get green builds.
- Keep `global.json` configured for `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` when TUnit is used.
- At the end of implementation work, run code-size and quality verification with `cloc`, `roslynator`, and the repository's strict .NET build/test checks, then fix actionable findings so oversized files and quality drift do not accumulate.
- Run verification in this order:
  - restore
  - build
  - test

### Code Style

- Follow `.editorconfig` and repository analyzers.
- Keep warnings clean; repository builds treat warnings as errors.
- Prefer simple, readable C# over clever abstractions.
- Prefer non-blocking coordination over coarse locking when practical; use concurrent collections, atomic state, and single-flight patterns instead of `lock`-heavy designs, because blocking synchronization has already proven to obscure concurrency behavior in this package.
- Prefer serializer-first JSON/schema handling; avoid ad-hoc manual special cases for `JsonElement`/`JsonNode`/schema objects when normal `System.Text.Json` serialization can represent them correctly.
- Prefer explicit SOLID object decomposition over large `partial` types; when responsibilities like registry, indexing, invocation, or schema handling can live in dedicated classes, extract real collaborators instead of only splitting files.
- Keep `McpGateway` focused on search/invoke orchestration only; do not embed registry or mutation responsibilities into the gateway type itself, because that mixes lifecycle/catalog mutation with runtime execution concerns.
- Keep public API names aligned with package identity `ManagedCode.MCPGateway`.
- Do not duplicate package metadata or version blocks inside project files unless a project-specific override is required.
- Use constants for stable tool names and protocol-facing identifiers.
- Never leave stable string literals inline in runtime code; extract named constants for diagnostic codes, messages, modes, keys, and other durable identifiers so changes stay centralized.
- Keep transport-specific logic inside the gateway and source registration abstractions, not scattered across the codebase.
- Keep the package dependency surface small and justified.
- Prefer direct generic DI registrations such as `services.TryAddSingleton<IService, Implementation>()` over lambda alias registrations when wiring package services, because the lambda style has already been called out as unreadable and error-prone in this repository.
- Keep runtime services DI-native from their public/internal constructors; types such as `McpGatewayRegistry` must be creatable through `IOptions<McpGatewayOptions>` and other DI-managed dependencies rather than ad-hoc state-only constructors, because the package design requires services to live fully inside the container.
- When emitting package identity to external protocols such as MCP client info, never hardcode a fake version string; use the actual assembly/build version so runtime metadata stays aligned with the package being shipped.
- For search-quality improvements, prefer mathematical or statistical ranking changes over hardcoded phrase lists or ad-hoc query text hacks, because the user explicitly wants tokenizer search to improve through general scoring behavior rather than manual exceptions.

### Critical (NEVER violate)

- Never rename the package away from `ManagedCode.MCPGateway` without explicit user approval.
- Never add Microsoft Agentic Framework dependencies unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Never publish to NuGet from the local machine without explicit user confirmation.
- Never use destructive git commands without explicit user approval.
- Never weaken tests, analyzers, or packaging checks to make CI pass.

### Boundaries

**Always:**

- Read `AGENTS.md` before editing code.
- Keep the repository package-first and library-first.
- Keep the gateway generic; do not bake in AIBase-specific or Orleans-specific runtime assumptions.

**Ask first:**

- breaking public API changes
- new runtime dependencies
- package metadata changes visible to consumers
- release version changes
- publish/release actions
